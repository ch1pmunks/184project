Submitted files:

coding_so_far.bmp - contains a picture of some code so far. we are using
the ray tracer framework from assignments 4-6 and the image shows the major changes
and additions. more information is in the actual image as red text in image.

sample_scene.bmp - contains a very simple scene (definitely not our final scene)
to test our project. image of 4 cubes in different positions at varying distances.

texture.png - contains a sample image of a possible texture to put on our
cube surfaces. the main point of the texture is to test bluriness of surfaces
as well (since solid colored primitives that are slighlty out of focus should mostly
have blurred edges but not much blurred surfaces, at least not to the point that
it would be easily noticeable).
